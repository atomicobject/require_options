== Description
Simply extract named arguments from a hash.  Require or allow a set of keys.

== Rationale
When using hashes to accomplish named-argument semantics for methods, we
noticed a common pattern:

* We often pull options out into local vars at the head of a method
* We often raise argument errors for missing keys in the hash

RequireOptions accomplishes both tasks succinctly.

== Install
  script/plugin git://github.com/atomicobject/require_options.git

or

  gem install require_options
  
== Example
  class Car
    include RequireOptions    

    def drive(opts)
      gear, speed = require_options(opts, :speed, :gear) 
      # opts 
    end    

    def put_in_trunk(opts)
      allow_options opts, :flare, :tire, :luggage
      # opts may contain any and all of the named keys, but no others
    end

    def register(opts)
      require_at_least_one opts, :license, :ssn
      # This method wants to use either opts[:license] OR opts[:ssn]
    end

    def park(opts)
      filter_options(opts, :spot)
      # filter out keys besides :spot, for security purposes, e.g.
    end
  end
